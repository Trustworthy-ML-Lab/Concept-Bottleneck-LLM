# Concept-Bottleneck-LLM

This is the repo for the Concept Bottleneck Large Language Model (CB-LLM), a pioneering approach to creating inherently interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs). 
CB-LLM sets a new standard with its high accuracy, scalability, and ability to provide clear, accurate explanations.

Our code will be released soon, please stay tuned!
